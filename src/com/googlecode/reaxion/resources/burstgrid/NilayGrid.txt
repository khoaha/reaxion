| The syntax for writing nodes into the BurstGrid is as follows:
| [Node ID#] [Node Type] [Ability | Attack | MinGauge Increase#| MaxGauge Increase#| Custom | HP Increase#] *[LinkedNodeA ID#_LinkedNodeB ID#_...]
| Example:
| 1 Ability BasicAttack *2 3 4 5
| A "!" indicates that more information is needed before I can add in what should belong there
| The Node Types and their functionality in the grid are as follows:
|  » Ability	Grants the character a passive ability
|  » Attack		Adds an attack to the character's repertoire
|  » MinGauge	Increases the low gauge limit
|  » MaxGauge	Increases the max gauge limit
|  » Rate		Increases the rate at which the gauge refills
|  » Strength	Increases the character's strength
|  » HP			Increases the character's max HP
