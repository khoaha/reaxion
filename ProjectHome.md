Gameplay revolves around the use of two characters in a tag team to defeat opponents. Each character has a unique level-up system that centers around buying "nodes" using acquired EXP. These nodes contain stat boosts, as well as moveset upgrades.

Characters can acquire abilities, which are passive mechanics shared between tag team allies that can range from healing HP to automatically dodging attacks. Characters can also unlock attacks, which are the main means through which they can defeat opponents.

The attack system revolves around the use of gauge. As time passes, characters in battle will accumulate gauge. To use an attack, a certain number of gauge points must be spent. Gauge is split into two halves: a blue-colored lower half, which is obtained first, and an orange-colored half which starts accumulating after blue gauge has been built. If a character has acquired orange-colored gauge, all of it will disappear after an attack is used, leaving only blue gauge.

Most of the game's battles will take place during missions, which can be accessed from the terminal menu. Each mission has discrete objectives and distinct enemies which must be defeated. Battles end when all of the opponents have 0 HP remaining. At the end of a battle, the player's time and HP are ranked and EXP is awarded accordingly.
